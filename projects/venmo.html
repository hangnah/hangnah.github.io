            <h1>Venmo Concept</h1>
            <p>In Spring 2018, I challenged myself to a design project that would help me to fully explore each part of
              the UX design process. I decided to tackle Venmo – a mobile payment service that makes payments between
              friends seamless. I gave myself one month to complete the project.</p>

              <h2>Why Venmo?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content-side-text">
              <p>As a college student, I frequently use Venmo to pay or request money from friends. Paying people back
                for
                food or housing-related bills is much easier than calculating change and paying with cash. Additionally,
                the social component of sharing descriptions of payments with other friends adds to the experience of
                using the mobile application.</p>
              <p>I wanted to see if Venmo was being used as it was intended to, and if people had expectations for the
                application that weren’t being met. With this in mind, I started off my redesign with understanding
                Venmo’s business goals and asking various Venmo users about their experience with Venmo.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div id="research" class="content-coloredbg">
            <div class="content-padding-normal">
              <h2>Business & User Research</h2>
              <p>The primary goal of Venmo is to make payments between people seamless and efficient. Beyond this, Venmo
                is aiming to expand its services beyond the application and allow users to use their Venmo balances to
                make purchases at participating vendors. The social component – the ability to interact with Venmo
                friends
                and their payments – contributes to the overall experience with the application, but is not the primary
                function of the application. Despite this, the landing page of the application still remains the global
                feed of payments between people across the world.
              </p>
              <p>Taking these goals into consideration, I created an online survey using Google Forms to see if the user
                goals aligned with the business goals.
              </p>
              <p>I surveyed 17 college students between the ages 19-22, 52.9% of whom were female and 47.1% of whom were
                male. (In retrospect, I should have expanded my pool of survey participants.) The survey consisted of
                questions regarding the frequencies that they used the app, features in the application that were
                important to them, and situational questions.</p>

                  <p>
                    The survey participants did not have a preference on their default privacy setting of their

                  <p>
                    94.1% of participants use Venmo to split food bills, and 52.9% of participants use Venmo to pay
                    larger amounts of money.
                  </p>
                  <p>82.4% of participants resort to other applications to calculate how to split the bill.</p>

                <div class="content-columns-items">
                  <h4>Finance Tracking</h4>
                  <p>
                    70.6% of participants use Venmo 1-2 times a week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    58.8% of participants never transfer their Venmo balances to their bank accounts.

              <p>Among the three features of banking apps, users commented more on the payment splitting and financial
                organization features than on the social component of the application. Many survey participants did not
                see the social component of the application as a necessary feature, as they only used the application
                for
                requesting and paying money. One surprising find was that many of the survey participants did not
                frequently transfer their Venmo balances to their bank accounts, and the payments that were being made
                were done in smaller sums.

                <p>Many users described their frustrations with Venmo’s lack of a convenient bill-splitting feature.
                  Users would have to resort to outside applications, such as their calculators, to resolve payments
                  with other people.</p>

              <div class="content-columns-items">
                <p>Although the landing page of the application is the global feed of transactions, users did not report
                  a high use or interaction with the social feeds.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="content-columns-items">
                <p>Given that over half of the surveyed users keep their money in their Venmo accounts, some expressed
                  interest in a finance tracker or summary of their spending within Venmo.</p>

            <div class="content-padding-normal">
              <p>Taking these survey results into consideration, I decided to focus on the following aspects on my
                redesign of the application:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A revised landing page that allows users to quickly pay and request money from people for a
                  particular bill</li>
                <li>An improved payment process</li>
                <li>A new finance tracking section that allows users to organize and “tag” past payments</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
              <h4>EXISTING ARCHITECTURE</h4>
              <p>Following the research, I analyzed the existing architecture of information in Venmo. What I found was
                a cluttered wealth of pages and a handful of less important pages that could be nested under a single
                page.</p>
              <h4>PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE</h4>
              <p>Laying out the different pages in Venmo helped me to visualize a better information architecture for
                the application. I decided that the landing page would take users straight to the payment screen, and
                divided the rest of the pages into four sections: Social, Activity, Profile, and Settings.</p>

          <div class="content-padding-normal">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>I began with sketching the layouts of each main page and experimenting with the layout of the navigation
              bar in order to make the main pages more accessible. By having a fixed navigation bar on the footer of
              the application instead of a side hamburger menu, users would be reminded by the different functions of
              the application and possible notifications. Additionally, the payment page became the landing page of the
              application.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="payment">

            <div class="content-side">
              <div>
                <h4>PAYMENT</h4>
                <p>I redesigned the payment page to emphasize the amount of money being paid or requested by users. In
                  doing so, I added a couple new features to the payment process: categories and split payments and
                  categories. Given my intent to add a financial organization feature, I added the categories section to
                  the payment page to allow users to later organize their spending.</p>

              </div>
              <div>
              <p>The split payment feature would help users refine their transactions when requesting money from
                multiple people, allowing them to enter different amounts of money for the same transaction. This would
                reduce the amount of transactions on the social feed and profile page, and help the user better
                organize their finances.</p>

                <h4>SOCIAL</h4>
                <p>Many users I surveyed did not use Venmo as a social application, so I removed the global feed and kept
                    the friends feed to keep aspects of the social component of the application. I also moved the search
                    bar to this page, which would allow users to search for their friends and pay or request money from
                    them from their profile pages.</p>

          <h4>ACTIVITY</h4>
          <p>This page would serve as a notifications page, where users could keep track of their recently
            completed transactions or view incomplete transactions requested by or from friends. Additionally, this
            page would also include a brief summary of the user’s spending history and a breakdown of their
            expenses given their self-categorization of their spending.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>PROFILE</h4>
          <p>The profile page would be similar to the existing profile page, giving the users the option of viewing
            their transactions in a manner similar to viewing the transactions of their friends.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>SETTINGS</h4>
          <p>Many of the existing standalone pages on the Venmo application can be nested under a single settings
            page. This page would lead users to a separate page with their privacy and notification settings, and
            would also allow users to transfer their Venmo balances to their bank accounts.</p>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>Given the short window of time I gave myself to complete this project, I recognized the importance of
            spending a majority of time on research to better understand the goals of both the product and the
            users. The user research helped me to see areas that Venmo could improve upon, especially in the
            payment process and desire for a better system to organize finances within the application.
            Unfortunately, I was unable to spend much time designing the wireframes, and subsequently was unable to
            fully flesh out the ideas I had hoped to pursue when restructuring the information architecture of the
            application. I was also unable to user test and design higher fidelity wireframes.</p>
