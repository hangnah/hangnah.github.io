              <h2>Why Venmo?</h2>
              <h4>Venmo is a great product, but can it be improved?</h4>
              <p>As a college student, I frequently use Venmo to pay or request money from friends. Paying people back
                for
                food or housing-related bills is much easier than calculating change and paying with cash. Additionally,
                the social component of sharing descriptions of payments with other friends adds to the experience of
                using the mobile application.</p>
              <p>I wanted to see if Venmo was being used as it was intended to, and if people had expectations for the
                application that weren’t being met. With this in mind, I started off my redesign with understanding
                Venmo’s business goals and asking various Venmo users about their experience with Venmo.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Business & User Research -->

              <div class="content-padding-normal">
                <h2>Business & User Research</h2>
                <p>The primary goal of Venmo is to make payments between people seamless and efficient. Beyond this,
                  Venmo
                  is aiming to expand its services beyond the application and allow users to use their Venmo balances to
                  make purchases at participating vendors. The social component – the ability to interact with Venmo
                  friends
                  and their payments – contributes to the overall experience with the application, but is not the
                  primary
                  function of the application. Despite this, the landing page of the application still remains the
                  global
                  feed of payments between people across the world.
                </p>
                <p>Taking these goals into consideration, I created an online survey using Google Forms to see if the
                  user
                  goals aligned with the business goals.
                </p>
                <p>I surveyed 17 college students between the ages 19-22, 52.9% of whom were female and 47.1% of whom
                  were
                  male. (In retrospect, I should have expanded my pool of survey participants.) The survey consisted of
                  questions regarding the frequencies that they used the app, features in the application that were
                  important to them, and situational questions.</p>

                <p>Among the three features of banking apps, users commented more on the payment splitting and financial
                  organization features than on the social component of the application. Many survey participants did
                  not
                  see the social component of the application as a necessary feature, as they only used the application
                  for
                  requesting and paying money. One surprising find was that many of the survey participants did not
                  frequently transfer their Venmo balances to their bank accounts, and the payments that were being made
                  were done in smaller sums.

                  <li>A revised landing page that allows users to quickly pay and request money from people for a
                    particular bill</li>
                  <li>An improved payment process</li>
                  <li>A new finance tracking section that allows users to organize and “tag” past payments</li>

                <h5>EXISTING ARCHITECTURE</h4>
                  <p>Following the research, I analyzed the existing architecture of information in Venmo. What I found
                    was
                    a cluttered wealth of pages and a handful of less important pages that could be nested under a
                    single
                    page.</p>
                  <h5>PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE</h5>
                  <p>Laying out the different pages in Venmo helped me to visualize a better information architecture
                    for
                    the application. I decided that the landing page would take users straight to the payment screen,
                    and
                    divided the rest of the pages into four sections: Social, Activity, Profile, and Settings.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>I decided to focus on three of the main pages listed in the revised architecture of the
              application:
              the landing/social, payment, and notifications pages. The following screenshots are what these pages
              in the application looked like in August 2019.</p>

            navigation
            bar in order to make the main pages more accessible. By having a fixed navigation bar on the footer of
            the application instead of a side hamburger menu, users would be reminded by the different functions of
            the application and possible notifications. Additionally, the payment page became the landing page of
            the application.</p>

          <h2>High-Fidelity</h2>
          <p>I decided to experiment with Adobe XD to design the final wireframes. The software was pretty
            intuitive,
            and the prototyping feature was simple to use. You can <a

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Given the short window of time I gave myself to complete this project, I recognized the importance of
            spending a majority of time on research to better understand the goals of both the product and the
            users. The user research helped me to see areas that Venmo could improve upon, especially in the
            payment process and desire for a better system to organize finances within the application.
            Unfortunately, I was unable to user test my final designs. Maybe in a future iteration...?</p>
