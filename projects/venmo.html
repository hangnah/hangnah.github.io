            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>In Spring 2018, I challenged myself to a design project that would help me to fully explore each part of
              the UX design process. I considered various applications that exist on my mobile phone, but decided to
              tackle Venmo – a mobile payment service that makes transactions with friends seamless. I gave myself one
              month to complete the project.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="problem">
            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>As a college student, I have used Venmo on a weekly basis to pay or request money from friends. Venmo
              has been the tool that me and many friends use when we go out for food, and sometimes Venmo is even used
              to help split the cost of rent or housing-related bills. Although it serves its function as a mobile
              payment service well, I was wary of the social aspect of the application. Venmo boasts itself as an
              application with great integration of social and financial components, but are its users also placing
              high value on the social aspect of the app? What qualms did people have with the app? The application
              itself is also fairly basic; the visual design is neither outstanding nor terrible. With these questions
              in mind, I set out to redesign Venmo.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="research">
            <h1>Business and User Research</h1>
            <p>Before I jumped into the user research and visual redesign of the application, I wanted to understand
              the general business goals of Venmo and see if these goals were being met by the app. The three main
              business goals of the application involved the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Conducting quick and easy transactions</li>
              <li>Connecting and sharing transactions with other people</li>
              <li>Splitting purchases among friends</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It became apparent that one of the biggest goals of Venmo was to introduce a social component to
              banking. Taking this into consideration, I designed an online user survey on Google Forms to see if
              people actually considered this goal to be important to them.</p>
            <p>I surveyed 17 college students between the ages 19-22, 52.9% of whom were female and 47.1% of whom were
              male. (In retrospect, I should have expanded my pool of survey participants.) The survey consisted of
              questions regarding the frequencies that they used the app, features in the application that were
              important to them, and situational questions.</p>
            <img src="../images/projects/venmo/research1.png" alt="Research" class="lightbox_trigger">
            <img src="../images/projects/venmo/research2.png" alt="Research" class="lightbox_trigger">
            <img src="../images/projects/venmo/research3.png" alt="Research" class="lightbox_trigger">
            <p>I discovered that outside of using the application to pay or request money from someone, people
              generally did not use the application. The situations that most people would use the application included
              splitting the food bill, paying housing-related items, and other miscellaneous transactions. One
              surprising find was that many of the survey participants did not frequently transfer the money they
              receive from Venmo payments back to their bank account. This raised a lot of questions about whether
              Venmo’s main goal of being a social platform was one that was actually important to its users.</p>
            <p>In the data I collected from the survey, I noticed a few common threads:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Many users described their frustrations with Venmo’s lack of a convenient bill-splitting feature.
                Users would have to resort to outside applications, such as their calculators, to solve payments with
                other people.</li>
              <li>Users described that their main purpose of using Venmo was to pay and request payments from others,
                especially with important reoccurring transactions such as house-related bills. However, Venmo does not
                currently offer an option to organize their transactions.</li>
              <li>The social feature is an added bonus, but users did not report a high use of the social feed on the
                application</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Taking these survey results into consideration, I decided to focus on the following aspects on my
              redesign of the application:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A new finance tracking section that categorizes and organizes past payments</li>
              <li>A “groups” feature that allows users to form groups with people they frequently pay</li>
              <li>Narrowed focus on the categorization of new transactions, groups, category, or expenses</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="infoarch">
            <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
            <p>Following the research, I analyzed the existing architecture of information in Venmo. What I found was a
              cluttered wealth of pages and a handful of less important pages that would be better when combined with
              others. </p>
            <img src="../images/projects/venmo/info1.png" alt="Old Information Architecture" class="lightbox_trigger">
            <p>Laying out the different pages in Venmo helped me to visualize a better information architecture for the
              application. I decided to nest all the pages under four main ones: Home, Search, Notifications, and
              Settings. Doing so would allow less confusion for users and would reduce the amount of steps users would
              need to take in order to perform basic tasks.</p>
            <img src="../images/projects/venmo/info2.png" alt="New Information Architecture" class="lightbox_trigger">
          </div>
          <div id="design">
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>I began with sketching the layouts of each page, coming up with different variations to highlight the
              payment feature and new finance expense tracking feature. I also experimented with the layout of
              navigation pages, making some pages more accessible to users who frequently use the application for those
              basic functions. By making these pages constantly visible on the bottom navigation bar instead of nested
              in a hamburger menu on the side, users would be reminded of important notifications or other features
              that may influence their decision to continue using the application, such as a more refined search page
              or less-cluttered settings page.</p>
            <div id="lowfi">
              <img src="../images/projects/venmo/lowfi.png" alt="Low-Fi Wireframes" class="lightbox_trigger">
            </div>
            <h2>Home</h2>
            <div id="home">
              <img src="../images/projects/venmo/designs/home.png" alt="Home" class="lightbox_trigger">
              <p>Initially, I thought about designing a landing page that automatically prompted users to pay or
                request
                money, but I reconsidered it, as some users would want to perform other functions quickly in the app.
                Instead, I kept the social feed but removed the global feed, and added a “groups” section that allowed
                users to quickly manage frequently paid groups. I also added a spreadsheet icon in the upper right
                corner
                that would take users to the expenses page. The expenses page would allow users to see track and
                organize
                their finances by date and category.</p>
              <h2>Search</h2>
              <img src="../images/projects/venmo/designs/search-1.png" alt="Search" class="lightbox_trigger projects-img-small">
              <p>The users that I surveyed were unaware of the QR code feature, which is a convenient way to send or
                request money from people whom they have never interacted with before. By making the QR scanner the
                highlight of the search page, users would be able to pay others more quickly.</p>
              <h2>Add</h2>
              <img src="../images/projects/venmo/designs/add.png" alt="Add" class="lightbox_trigger">
              <p>This new add button would allow users to quickly add several functions: transactions, categories,
                groups, or expenses. Tapping on “transactions” would lead users to a page similar to the existing
                payment
                page on Venmo, but would include a categories tab that users could use to categorize the payment.
                Similarly, the “category,” “group,” and “expense” buttons would lead users to pages that allow them to
                add a new category, group, or expense, respectively.</p>
              <h2>Activity</h2>
              <img src="../images/projects/venmo/designs/activity.png" alt="Activity" class="lightbox_trigger">
              <p>The “activity” page would serve as a notifications page, where users could keep track of their
                recently
                completed transactions or view incomplete transactions requested by or from friends. Having a page for
                the user’s recent activity would allow users to keep track of their recent expenses and quickly view
                their transactions on a single page.</p>
              <h2>Settings</h2>
              <img src="../images/projects/venmo/designs/settings.png" alt="Settings" class="lightbox_trigger projects-img-small">
              <p>Many of the existing standalone pages on the Venmo application can be nested under a single settings
                page. The main settings page includes a nested settings button, which would lead users to a separate
                page
                with privacy and notification settings.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="summary">
              <h1>Summary</h1>
              <p>Given the short window of time I gave myself to complete this project, I recognized the importance of
                spending a majority of time on research to better understand the goals of both the product and the
                users.
                Because of this limited time frame, I was unable to spend much time in the design process, and
                subsequently, was unable to fully flesh out ideas that I had hoped to pursue when restructuring the
                information architecture of the application. I was also unable to user test and reiterate upon the
                wireframes.</p>
