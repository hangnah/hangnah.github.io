            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>The UCLA PEERS Clinic is a program that teaches social skills to adolescents and young adults with
              autistic spectrum disorder. My team of three other students met with the founder of the program and were
              asked to redesign the PEERS website.</p>
            <p>As the client partner, I was responsible for managing communication between the client and my team
              through email. I also conducted research and designed the high-fidelity wireframes.</p>
            <p class="small-text">This project was a part of a user experience design class in the Information Studies
              department (INF STD 279) at UCLA. We were given 10 weeks to complete this project.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="problem">
            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>Currently, the website is difficult to navigate. The clinic staff members were receiving hundreds of
              emails and phone calls from potential participants asking about information that should be easily found
              on the website.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="research">
            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>In order to understand the main problem pages on the website, our team held two focus groups: one with
              staff members and one with program participants/family members. We facilitated discussions around
              experiences with the website and changes they want to see. Some of the questions we asked include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the process of signing up a patient for the program? Are there any difficulties? Do people
                usually have questions when signing up?
              </li>
              <li>What is one service you wish you knew about the program before signing up?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We were able to narrow down our focus to several pages, including the resources and home pages. By
              reorganizing these pages, the amount of questions that staff members receive would be reduced, and
              potential program participants will be able to easily find information on the website.</p>
            <p class="small-text">A couple approaches didn’t work: cognitive walkthrough of the website from a
              patient's perspective (too cumbersome); Google Analytics (due to the nature of the PEERS website, which
              is hosted under the larger Semel Institute website, it was difficult to single out the web pages specific
              to the clinic).</p>
          </div>
          <div id="design">
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>Initially, our team was eager to jump into the visual redesign of the website. We quickly realized that
              in order to reduce clutter on the website, we needed to reorganize the content and existing pages.</p>
            <img src="../images/projects/peers/googlesheets.png" alt="Google Sheets Organization" class="lightbox_trigger">
            <p>We were able to better visualize the structure of the website after listing out all the existing pages
              on a whiteboard. We organized our whiteboard session on a Google Spreadsheet.</p>
            <img src="../images/projects/peers/low.png" alt="Low-Fidelity Wireframes" class="lightbox_trigger">
          </div>
          <p>Taking our new content map, we sketched low-fidelity wireframes of each page and laid out the new
            organization of the website. To create the high-fidelity wireframes, we each individually redesigned
            several pages on Figma, an online collaborative tool for designing wireframes.</p>
          <img src="../images/projects/peers/high.png" alt="High-Fidelity Wireframes" class="lightbox_trigger">
          <p>I was responsible for the navigation bar, Home, Resources, FAQ, and Contact pages.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="deliverables">
          <h1>Deliverables</h1>
          <p>We presented our client the high-fidelity wireframes and an InVision prototype of our redesign. We also
            collaborated on a 30-page report with our research-backed recommendations and next steps that they can
            take. If you would like to see the full document, please contact me here.</p>
