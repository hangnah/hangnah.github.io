              <p>The UCLA PEERS Clinic is a program that teaches social skills to adolescents and young adults with
                autistic spectrum disorder. My team of three other students met with the founder of the program and were
                asked to redesign the PEERS website.
              </p>
              <p>As the client partner, I was responsible for managing communication between the client and my team
                through email. I also conducted research and designed the high-fidelity wireframes.

              <p class="small-text">This project was a part of a user experience design class in the Information Studies
                department (INF STD
                279) at UCLA. We were given 10 weeks to complete this project.</p>

            <div class="content-side-text">
              <p>Currently, the website is difficult to navigate. The clinic staff members were receiving hundreds of
                emails and phone calls from potential participants asking about information that should be easily found
                on
                the website.</p>

            <div class="content-padding-normal">
              <h2>User Research</h2>
              <p>In order to understand the main problem pages on the website, our team held two focus groups: one with
                staff members and one with program participants/family members. We facilitated discussions around
                experiences with the website and changes they want to see. Some of the questions we asked include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>What is the process of signing up a patient for the program? Are there any difficulties? Do people
                  usually have questions when signing up?
                </li>
                <li>What is one service you wish you knew about the program before signing up?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>We were able to narrow down our focus to several pages, including the resources and home pages. By
                reorganizing these pages, the amount of questions that staff members receive would be reduced, and
                potential program participants will be able to easily find information on the website.</p>

              <p class="small-text">A couple approaches didn’t work: cognitive walkthrough of the website from a
                patient's perspective (too
                cumbersome); Google Analytics (due to the nature of the PEERS website, which is hosted under the larger
                Semel Institute website, it was difficult to single out the web pages specific to the clinic).

          <div class="content-side">
            <div>
              <p>I began with sketching the layouts of each main page and experimenting with the layout of the
                navigation
                bar in order to make the main pages more accessible. By having a fixed navigation bar on the footer of
                the application instead of a side hamburger menu, users would be reminded by the different functions of
                the application and possible notifications. Additionally, the payment page became the landing page of
                the
                application.</p>

            <div>
              <p>We were able to better visualize the structure of the website after listing out all the existing pages
                on a whiteboard. We organized our whiteboard session on a Google Spreadsheet.</p>

          <p>We presented our client the high-fidelity wireframes and an InVision prototype of our redesign. We also
