                        organizations in San Francisco. By gamifying the experience and providing an option to connect
                        with friends online, this project aimed to be a stepping stone for people to begin their
                        volunteerism journey.</h4>

                        Girls in Tech SF) and received an honorable mention from the judges. I worked in a team with
                        four other people, and taught design thinking principles to my team. I was the sole designer.

                            community.</strong> Our goal was to address one issue in San Francisco and design a solution
                        for it. To spur ideas, a couple of representatives from different community organizations were
                        invited to speak about their organizations’ respective missions.</p>

                        to help.
                    </h4>
                    <p>One organization stood out to my team – <strong>the St. Anthony Foundation, an organization that
                            provides free services to the homeless community in San Francisco.</strong> A couple of the
                        services include a dining hall that serves over 2,000 meals each day and a free technology
                        center that gives homeless individuals access to computers.</p>
                    <p>My team wanted to explore this issue of homelessness even further. With over 8,000 homeless
                        individuals and 800,000 residents in San Francisco, I knew we needed to <strong>incorporate
                            human compassion</strong> into our project solution to galvanize change.</p>
                    <p>We identified three groups involved in this space:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Homeless individuals
                        </li>
                        <li>Non-profit organizations
                        </li>
                        <li>Volunteers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>My team preliminarily discussed a few project ideas, including an Airbnb-type service to connect
                        homeless individuals with willing hosts, or a way to simplify the eviction process for
                        individuals before they become homeless. While these ideas were worth exploring, we were
                        concerned about the technology needed to access these services. Because of this, <strong>we
                            shifted our users from homeless individuals to people who have the resources to contribute
                            to the homeless community.</strong>

                    <h4>The core value of this project was compassion. My team considered several project ideas to drive
                        compassion for the homeless community.
                    </h4>
                    <p><strong>The idea of fostering a relationship with homeless individuals</strong> would allow
                        people to directly show compassion to the homeless community. We considered the idea of an
                        independent sponsorship program to bridge these relationships, but ran into the problem of
                        finding willing individuals to participate in the program.</p>

                    <p><strong>We decided to leverage organizations like St. Anthony’s to form the foundations of these
                            relationships.</strong> My team began considering ways to encourage people to volunteer with
                        the end goal of fostering relationships with the people they would interact with.</p>
                    <p>Bouncing around ideas for this was difficult, as my team members and I had differing opinions on
                        the solution. <strong>I suggested coming up with user personas</strong> to narrow down the scope
                        and help direct our decisions for the project.</p>

                        profiles for three individuals living in San Francisco. We defined general perspectives on
                        volunteering and considered users who <strong>shared a similar sentiment of not previously being
                            involved with volunteer programs.</strong>

                                            concerns are for her immediate family,</strong> as she wants to take care of

                        for the project was to build relationships with individuals in the homeless community. (We
                        didn’t consider user acquisition of our product, as we assumed that people using the application
                        would be those already interested in finding out how to volunteer.)

                        encouraging volunteers to build relationships with homeless individuals.
                    </h4>
                    <p>The first decision I made was to <strong>create a mobile application in order to reflect the ease
                            of volunteering.</strong> To encourage user retention with the application, some of my team
                        members suggested that we to <strong>gamify the experience</strong> and allow users to earn
                        badges and climb statuses as they continued to volunteer. As a team, we also decided to add a
                        <strong>social component</strong> to the application so users would be able to see their
                        friends’ activities at organizations, further encouraging them to volunteer on their own time.
                    </p>
                    <p>With a little over 12 hours left in the hackathon, I organized the information architecture and
                        designed high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes while providing design support for my team with
                        the application onboarding experience.</p>

                    <h4>The onboarding experience aimed to give users an idea of how easy it is to begin their volunteer
                        journeys.</h4>
                    <p>We took inspiration from Duolingo, a language learning application, and its onboarding experience
                        for new users. Duolingo’s onboarding process asks users to quickly assess their level of
                        language mastery and outline their personal goals with using the application, personalizing
                        their language learning experience. </p>

                    <p>In our onboarding experience, we asked new users about their goals for volunteering and
                        categorized the types of contributions they could make (time, money, and items). By limiting the
                        number of potential contributions users could make, <strong>we were setting the expectation that
                            volunteering can be easy.</strong> We also <strong>introduced the gamification features to
                            further validate and reward users</strong> for taking the first step to becoming a
                        volunteer.</p>
                    <p>Taking the sketches that my team and I had created, I designed a high-fidelity prototype for the
                        onboarding experience.</p>

                                <p>By eventually partnering with non-profit organizations such as St. Anthony’s in San
                                    Francisco, we hoped to directly connect volunteers with organizations through our
                                    mobile application and <strong>streamline the process of volunteers signing up and
                                        tracking their volunteering.</strong> Features like the <strong>Time
                                        page</strong> would require volunteers to coordinate with the site supervisors
                                    and record their volunteer hours directly in the application. This feature would be
                                    useful for students who need volunteer hours, and <strong>would encourage volunteers
                                        to further foster relationships with those they meet at the
                                        organizations.</strong></p>

                                        application.</strong> With each item or monetary donation, or time spent
                                    volunteering, volunteers would gain experience points (XP) to level up as a
                                    volunteer. This feature would hopefully <strong>lead volunteers to develop the habit
                                        of voluntarily spending their time at charitable organizations.</strong> I
                                    designed all the icons to represent the status levels of a volunteer.</p>

                                        option to like or comment on friends’ activities,</strong> as we did not want

                                        individuals at these local organizations,</strong> or form a sponsorship-like
                                    program with them. Because every individual has a different story, we wanted to
                                    create a space for understanding and empathy in these relationships.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Defining a target audience and user base is essential for driving design
                                decisions.</strong> My team consisted of people who were new to hackathons and design
                            thinking, so our initial ideations were broad, exciting, and perplexing. But after I led my
                            team to create user personas to better frame our problem, it was easier to narrow down our
                            scope. Personas also helped us to develop the goal of our project: to encourage new
                            volunteers to begin their volunteer journeys and eventually build relationships with the
                            people they served.</li>
                        <li><strong>Every single screen, design element, or interaction should contribute to the end
                                goal of the user.</strong> My team quickly became overwhelmed by the idea of
                            gamification and had a few disagreements over how to approach gamifying the experience.
                            However, I advocated for the user personas we had defined together and helped to reframe our
                            project goal of encouraging volunteerism, so the gamification feature became a secondary
                            priority. Setting that expectation helped to simplify the user experience of the
                            application. </li>
                        <li>And a bonus takeaway: <strong>It’s possible to sleep at hackathons!</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Designing this application from scratch was an exciting process. After being given the prompt to
                        “hack for humanity,” it was easy for my team to jump between many project ideas, but guiding my
                        team to think from the perspective of our users helped us to define our single project idea.</p>
                    <p>Given that this project was completed during a 24-hour hackathon, we were unable to complete any
                        in-person user research on our initial idea and on the end prototype I designed. As a result, a
                        lot of our design decisions were based on assumptions from personal experience and our user
                        personas. If we were given more time, I would have also done deeper research on the effects of
                        gamification on activity retention.</p>
                    <p>Participating in this hackathon was a great opportunity to work alongside strangers from
                        different backgrounds who quickly became a cohesive team: two recent college graduates, one high
                        school student, one engineer, and one mother. Being able to witness many of their first
                        introductions to design thinking throughout the hackathon confirmed my passion for user
                        experience design, and encourages me even more to continue advocating for the user in everything
                        I design.</p>
