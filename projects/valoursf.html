              <h4>Hack for humanity.</h4>
              <p>The topic of the hackathon was <span class="bold">social and civic issues in the San Francisco
                  community.</span> Our goal was to
                address one issue in San Francisco and design a solution for it. In order to provide more context for
                potential projects, a couple of representatives from different community organizations were invited to
                speak about their organization’s respective missions.</p>

                <h2>Context & User Research</h2>
                <h4>Homelessness is a big issue – we decided to focus our uses on people who have the capacity to help.
                </h4>
                <p>One organization in particular stood out to my team – <span class="bold">the St. Anthony Foundation,
                    an organization
                    that provides free services to the homeless community in San Francisco.</span> We were drawn to the
                  services
                  that this organization provided for the community: a dining room that serve over 2,000 meals per day,
                  a free technology center that allows homeless individuals access to computers, and many other
                  programs.
                </p>
                <p>My team wanted to explore the issue of <span class="bold">homelessness</span> even further. With over
                  800,000 residents and
                  8,000 homeless individuals in San Francisco, we knew we needed to <span class="bold">incorporate human
                    compassion</span> into
                  our project solution.
                </p>
                <p>We identified three groups involved in this problem space:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Homeless individuals</li>
                  <li>Non-profit organizations</li>
                  <li>Volunteers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My team preliminarily discussed several project ideas, including an Airbnb-type service to connect
                  the homeless with willing hosts, or a way to simplify the eviction process for individuals before they
                  become homeless. While these ideas would create a direct impact for the homeless community, we were
                  concerned about the technology they would need to access these services. Because of this, we <span
                    class="bold">shifted
                    our focus from homeless individuals</span> to people who have the resources to contribute to the
                  homeless
                  community.
                </p>

              <h2>Ideation</h2>
              <h4>Compassion was a core value that we defined, so we considered several project ideas aligned with
                compassion for the homeless community. </h4>
              <p><span class="bold">The idea of fostering a relationship with homeless individuals</span> became a
                recurring topic because it
                would allow people to directly show compassion to the homeless community. We considered the idea of an
                independent sponsorship program to bridge these relationships, but ran into the problem of finding
                willing individuals to participate in the program. </p>
              <p>Thinking back to the St. Anthony Foundation, we <span class="bold">decided to leverage organizations
                  like St. Anthony’s to
                  form the foundation of these relationships.</span> My team began considering ways to encourage people
                to
                volunteer at these organizations with the end goal of fostering relationships with the people they would
                be interacting with.</p>
              <img src="../images/projects/valoursf/ideation.jpg" alt="Ideation">
              <p>Bouncing around ideas for this was difficult, as my team members and I had differing opinions on how to
                approach the design of such a solution. <span class="bold">I suggested coming up with user
                  personas</span> to narrow our scope of
                the project and help direct our decisions for the application.

              <h2>The Design Process</h2>
              <h4>All of the design decisions we made were to encourage more volunteerism, ultimately encouraging
                volunteer relationships with homeless individuals. </h4>
              <p>Our first decision was to <span class="bold">create a mobile application</span> in order to represent
                the easy access to
                volunteering. To encourage user retention with the application, we decided to <span class="bold">gamify
                  the experience</span> and
                allow users to earn badges and climb statuses as they continued to volunteer. We also decided to <span
                  class="bold">add a
                  social component</span> so users would be able to see their friends’ activities at organizations,
                further
                encouraging them to volunteer on their own time.</p>

              <!-- Onboarding -->
              <h5>Onboarding</h5>
              <h6>We designed an onboarding experience that would affirm users of their contributions to local
                organizations, hoping to give users an idea of how they could easily begin their volunteer journey.
              </h6>
              <p>We took inspiration from Duolingo, a language learning application, and its onboarding experience for
                new users. In Duolingo’s onboarding process, users are asked to quickly assess their level of language
                mastery and outline their personal goals for the application, creating a personalized experience. These
                first few screens also give users a good idea of what to expect in the application.</p>
              <p>For our onboarding experience, we <span class="bold">gave new users the opportunity to take ownership
                  over their
                  volunteering journey</span> by answering several questions on their goals for volunteering and
                categorizing the
                types of contributions they could make (time, money, and items). By simplifying their potential
                contributions, we also <span class="bold">set the expectation that volunteering can be easy.</span>
              </p>
              <p>We also wanted to <span class="bold">introduce the gamification features to further validate and reward
                  users</span> for taking
                the first step to becoming a volunteer.
              </p>

              <!-- Information Architecture -->
              <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
              <h6>With the goals of encouraging more volunteerism and empowering users with resources to volunteer, we
                consolidated all the volunteer resources to a single page.
              </h6>
              <p>By reducing the application to have only three main pages, the only major interaction users would have
                with the application would be with the <span class="bold">Volunteer</span> page. The <span
                  class="bold">Profile</span> and <span class="bold">Friends</span> pages served as ways for
                users to track their progress and view their friends’ progress.</p>

                            automatically generated task</span> for volunteers who are unsure of how to contribute to
                          organizations.

                        <li>To encourage volunteer retention at the same organizations, I included a <span

                          volunteer with.</li>

              <h2>Solutions</h2>
              <h4>We decided to name our application <span class="bold">Valour SF</span> to reflect our user’s
                empowerment and compassion from volunteering in the San Francisco community.</h4>
              <p>Our ultimate goal for this project was to <span class="bold">empower the user through incentivizing
                  volunteering and destigmatizing homeless shelter volunteering,</span> and to <span
                  class="bold">empower the homeless through deepening relationships with consistent volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p>We presented our solutions through four avenues: Partnership, Gamification, Friends, and Humanization.
              </p>

              <!-- Partnership -->
              <h5>Partnership</h5>
              <p>By eventually partnering with non-profit organizations such as St. Anthony’s in San Francisco, we hoped
                to directly connect volunteers with organizations through our mobile application and <span
                  class="bold">streamline the
                  process of volunteers signing up and tracking their volunteering.</span> Features like the <span
                  class="bold">Time</span> page would
                allow volunteers to coordinate for the site supervisors and record their volunteer hours directly in the
                application. This feature would be useful for students who need volunteer hours, and <span
                  class="bold">would encourage
                  volunteers to further foster relationships with those they meet</span> at the organizations.</p>

              <!-- Gamification -->
              <h5>Gamification</h5>
              <p>Gamifying the experience with achievements, status levels, and experience points <span
                  class="bold">gives an extra
                  incentive for users to continue volunteering and using the application.</span> With each item or
                monetary
                donation, or time spent volunteering, volunteers would gain experience points (XP) to level up as a
                volunteer. This feature would hopefully <span class="bold">lead volunteers to develop the habit of
                  voluntarily spending
                  their time</span> at charitable organizations. I designed all the icons to represent the status levels
                of a
                volunteer.</p>

              <!-- Friends -->
              <h5>Friends</h5>
              <p>The friends feed would allow volunteers to see their friends’ status levels, recently acquired badges,
                and activities. One decision we came to was <span class="bold">omitting the option to like or comment on
                  activities,</span> as we
                did not want volunteerism to become a competition with other people.</p>

              <!-- Humanization -->
              <h5>Humanization</h5>
              <p>(Because this feature was one that was beyond the scope of our time at the hackathon, we filed away
                this idea as a future feature.) To bring it back to compassion as our core value and relationships as
                the end goal, we wanted to design an experience that would <span class="bold">allow volunteers to have a
                  one-to-one
                  relationship with homeless individuals</span> at these local organizations, or form a sponsorship-like
                program
                with them. Because every individual has a different story, we wanted to create a space for understanding
                and empathy in these relationships.</p>

          <!-- Takeaways -->
          <div id="takeaways">
            <div class="project-content-item">
              <h2>Takeaways</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Defining a target audience and user base is essential for directing design
                    decisions.</span> Given that
                  most of my team consisted of people who new to hackathons and design thinking, initially ideating
                  solutions to a huge problem was exciting. But after I led my team to create user personas to better
                  frame our problem, it was easier to scope project ideas. Personas also helped us to understand the
                  purpose of the application: to encourage new volunteers to begin their volunteer journeys and
                  eventually build relationships with the people they served.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Every single screen, design element, or interaction should contribute to the end
                    goal of the user.</span>
                  My team became quickly overwhelmed by the idea of gamification and had a few disagreements over how to
                  approach gamifying the experience, but I advocated for the user personas we defined and the goal of
                  the application: to encourage volunteerism. The gamification feature then became a secondary priority,
                  and we were able to simplify the user experience of the application. </li>
                <li>And a bonus takeaway: <span class="bold">It’s possible to sleep at hackathons!</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Designing this application from scratch was an exciting process. After being given the prompt and some
                time to think about how to “hack for humanity,” it was easy for my team to quickly jump around different
                project ideas, but remembering that every design process begins with the users helped us define a single
                project idea.</p>
              <p>Given that this project was completed in a 24-hour hackathon, we were unable to complete any in-person
                user research on our initial idea and the end prototype I designed. As a result, a lot of our design
                decisions were based on assumptions of the user personas and off of one of our team members, as she was
                a high school student who needed volunteer hours for school. If we were given more time, I would have
                also done deeper research on the effects of gamification on activity retention.</p>
              <p>Participating in this hackathon was a great opportunity to work alongside strangers who quickly became
                a cohesive team: two recent graduates, one high school student, one engineer, and one mother. Being able
                to witness many of their first introductions to design thinking in the first workshop confirmed my
                passion for user experience design, and encourages me even more to continue advocating for the user in
                everything I design.</p>
