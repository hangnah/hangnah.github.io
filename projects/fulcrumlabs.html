                    <h4>How can online learning be more interactive and engaging?</h4>
                    <p>Fulcrum Labs is revolutionizing the way learners achieve mastery in various industries with its
                        machine learning platform. Using data-driven analytics, <strong>the platform presents learners
                            with material based on their performance throughout their courses.</strong> Learners are
                        able to learn at their own pace and are presented with either text or video modules, and
                        complete assessments at the end of each course section. </p>
                    <p>Part of my research for this project stemmed from a psychology course on perception and learning
                        that I took at UCLA. <strong>Perceptual learning is fostered through repeated exposure and
                            experience with the presented stimuli,</strong> and these skills help form the foundation
                        for other complex cognitive processes such as language processing and decision making. For
                        example, perceptual learning can explain why an individual’s physical learning environment
                        affects his or her learning, as he or she will be better equipped to respond in that particular
                        environment more than other environments. Additionally, note-taking contributes to better
                        information processing, as it allows individuals to visually organize materials and reduces
                        cognitive load during learning.</p>
                    <p>The existing interface for Fulcrum Lab’s learning product was simple and conducive to learning,
                        but I wanted to explore the addition of interactive elements to increase learner engagement with
                        the platform and retention of material. <strong>Therefore, my objective was to introduce a
                            note-taking system and a dashboard customization feature to make learning more engaging for
                            the user.</strong></p>

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Design I</h5>
                    <h4>I designed a native note-taking feature and created templates for learners to customize their
                        dashboards.
                    </h4>
                    <p>The design proposals needed to be native in the current platform, so I introduced in-app changes
                        to the dashboard interface. I decided to design the note-taking feature directly to the right of
                        the current module for learners to easily take notes as they proceed through the course. I
                        tucked the dashboard customization feature to the bottom of the dashboard, as this feature was
                        cosmetic and I assumed would not contribute to learner engagement and retention as strongly as
                        note-taking would.</p>

                                <p>I designed a native note-taking that would allow learners to directly interact with
                                    the text module. Learners would be able to interact with the text in two ways:
                                    highlighting a section of text or adding a note to a section of text. In order to
                                    access these options, learners would have to highlight a section of text with their
                                    cursors, in which the “Highlight” and “Add Note” icons would toggle from disabled to
                                    enabled. After the learners highlight or add a note, an indicator would appear to
                                    the right of the text as a reference point to their notes. Additionally, I designed
                                    a separate “Notes” page for learners to access all of their notes in the course.</p>

                    <p>I conducted two in-person user tests with people who had no previous knowledge of Fulcrum Labs. I
                        prompted the users with tasks to gauge the usability of my designs and screen-recorded their
                        interactions with the prototype as I took notes of my observations.</p>

                                <p>Both users were confused with how to take notes. Although both the “Highlight” and
                                    “Add Note” icons toggled from disabled to enabled after the users highlighted the
                                    text with their cursors, both users navigated only to the highlight button.</p>
                                <p>Considering this interaction, I decided to <strong>make the “Add Notes” button larger
                                        and present it on the right side of the screen at all times.</strong> Instead of
                                    assuming that learners would use their cursors to highlight the text in order to
                                    make a note, I labeled the note-taking icon to make this feature more apparent for
                                    learners.</p>

                                <p>When I tasked the two users with customizing their dashboard theme, both of them
                                    looked through their account settings before finding the pop-up link at the bottom
                                    of the page. Additionally, after the users had found the theme customization pop-up,
                                    they chose one of the first few themes without scrolling through the second page of
                                    themes.</p>
                                <p>In order to “onboard” learners on how to customize their dashboards, I decided to
                                    <strong>gamify the dashboard customization feature</strong> by unlocking this
                                    feature for learners as they progress through the course. I also reduced the number
                                    of available themes, as learners did not seem to prioritize this new feature in
                                    their learning experience.</p>

                    <h4>Communicate well. Test early and often.</h4>
                    <p>Throughout the design process, I recognized the importance of user testing to either support or
                        undermine my design decisions. In the research and discussion phase of these two ideas, I was
                        relying on assumptions and feedback from the rest of the product team to drive my design
                        decisions. With user testing, I was able to test these assumptions and the usability of my
                        designs. Ultimately, after meeting with the product design team and discussing the viability of
                        my design propositions, we decided to scrap the idea of customization, as it didn’t seem to add
                        as much value to the learning platform as the note-taking feature.</p>
                    <p>Being able to take ownership of this project from research to testing was exciting, and I am
                        grateful to the product team at Fulcrum Labs for giving me the opportunity to do so. While I
                        learned a great deal about collaborating between the design team and receiving feedback on
                        designs, one thing I would have done differently is communicate my ideas earlier and more often
                        throughout the project. That would have helped me to develop one product feature more thoroughly
                        rather than splitting my focus between two features.</p>
                    <p>At the end of my internship, I presented and delivered my research, wireframes, and prototypes to
                        the team.</p>
