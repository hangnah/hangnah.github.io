              <p>As an analysis of ethical surveillance in my human-computer interaction class, my team of three other
                UCLA graduate students researched the ethics of data collection and design values of ridesharing
                applications, specifically in Uber. We applied concepts of personas, infrastructural inversion, and
                values in design to complete our analysis, and proposed three design solutions that reflected our
                findings.

              <h2>Research & Persona</h2>
              <p>In many major cities, ridesharing applications bring much convenience and affordability that other
                transportation services cannot offer. However, in order to do so, these ridesharing companies must have
                a record of user location data and traffic patterns to streamline their services – heavy location
                surveillance that some individuals may not be aware of. With this issue of ethical surveillance in
                ridesharing applications in mind, my team used personas, situations, and infrastructural inversion* to
                uncover our design values that would help us analyze Uber’s design decisions and come to our own design
                decisions.
              </p>
              <p class="small-text">*Infrastructural inversion is a phrase coined by Star and Bowker in their book <a
                  href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sorting-things-out" target="_blank">Sorting Things Out</a>. The
                process of infrastructural inversion involves diving into the infrastructure (or classification) and
                analyzing the details of the product at hand.</p>

                  <h4>FAMILIARIZATION</h4>
                  <p>My team familiarized ourselves with the interface of the Uber application and found it to be
                    seamless, intuitive, and legible, leading us to believe that Uber values the usability, simplicity,
                    and convenience of its application by hiding the inner-workings of the service. Uber does allow
                    users
                    to opt-in or -out of their data collection services and links to their full privacy policy online,
                    but
                    this affordance doesn’t allow transparency with how Uber uses the data collected from its users (for
                    example, <a
                      href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/how-uber-uses-its-data-bank.asp"

                  <h4>DEFAMILIARIZATION</h4>
                  <p>How does Uber get away with collecting tons of data without worrying its users? In order to answer
                    this, my team used defamiliarization to examine the navigational cues that lead Uber’s users
                    throughout the application. With the primary purpose of Uber being to request a ride, this one-track
                    mindset is evident via the design of the landing screen, not allowing its users to strongly consider
                    the data collection settings or their location privacies. The simplicity and intuitive nature of
                    Uber’s design enables its users to forgo the constant location surveillance and data collection
                    happening under the hood of the application.</p>

              <p>Drawing from our infrastructural inversion and an article on surveillance capitalism by Zuboff (2015),
                we
                defined five of the following design values needed for ethical surveillance. These values respond to
                Uber’s concern with efficiency and usability, and also align with user values in data collection and
                location surveillance. We used these values to drive our design decisions.

                    Maps). Each application has its own algorithm for calculating the fastest route for travel, which
                    can
                    lead drivers to take their riders through more obscure neighborhoods to get to their destinations.
                    The
                    proposed redesign would allow riders to preview all the possible routes and select one before
                    submitting a request for a ride.</p>

                  <p>The Uber Pool Express option determines a “smart spot” for riders to be picked up and dropped
                    off,
                    but ignores other factors like the safety and comfortability of riders. This proposed design would
                    allow riders to rate their drop-off and pick-up locations after the ride, improving Uber’s
                    algorithm
                    and giving agency to future riders in choosing a ride with a particular pick-up or drop-off
                    location.

                  <p>Uber drivers have a right to record their rides using dashboard cameras both in and outside of
                    their
                    vehicles, and more drivers have been installing camera devices to protect themselves from false
                    claims.
                    Riders are often unaware of this, so in order to inform riders of the possibility of being recorded
                    during a particular ride, we proposed having a opt-in or -out dialog in the rider’s application
                    before
                    each ride with a camera device. This would also require drivers to register their devices with the
                    Uber
                    application.</p>

                <p>Stephanie just completed a work trip to Chicago. She is at Reagan National airport and it is after
                  midnight. Stephanie needs to get home quickly to her apartment in downtown Washington, DC. The bus and
                  metro have closed for the night, and the line for taxis seems to be taking at least 20 minutes. The
                  fastest and cheapest option would be to call an Uber carpool to get home. Stephanie hesitates to call
                  an
                  UberPool. The last time she took an UberPool, she was dropped off in an unsafe part of her
                  neighborhood.
                  Stephanie does not want this to happen again, especially because it is so late at night.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>In all the design proposals my team came up with, the common value we upheld was agency – being able to
              control what types of data that is collected and knowing how the data is being used. Regarding ethical
              surveillance, I believe that having agency over how our personal data is collected leads us to feel more
              empowered by corporations that leverage big data without our active knowledge. Also, given our short
              timeline for the project, we didn’t fully flesh out the tradeoffs for the design propositions; after
              presenting our project to our class, my team and I recognized the biases that riders could potentially
              contribute to through the proposed rating system or route selection designs. Digging further into these
              concepts would help us combat any forms of bias that we may be contributing to in our design.
              Overall, this practice of critically thinking about existing pervasive technologies and the surveillance
              that accompanies them opened my eyes to examine other mindless interactions I have with technologies,
              growing my interest in research and analysis as a designer.
