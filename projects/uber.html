            <h4>As an analysis of ethical surveillance in my human-computer interaction class, my team of three other
              UCLA graduate students researched the ethics of data collection and design values of ridesharing
              applications, specifically in Uber. We applied concepts of personas, infrastructural inversion, and
              values in design to complete our analysis, and proposed three design solutions that reflected our
              findings.</h4>

              <p>In many major cities, ridesharing applications bring much convenience and affordability that other
                transportation services cannot offer. However, in order to do so, these ridesharing companies must have
                a record of user location data and traffic patterns to streamline their services – heavy location
                surveillance that some individuals may not be aware of. With this issue of ethical surveillance in
                ridesharing applications in mind, my team used personas, situations, and infrastructural inversion* to
                uncover our design values that would help us analyze Uber’s design decisions and come to our own design
                decisions.
              </p>
              <p class="small-text">*Infrastructural inversion is a phrase coined by Star and Bowker in their book <a
                  href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sorting-things-out" target="_blank">Sorting Things Out</a>. The
                process of infrastructural inversion involves diving into the infrastructure (or classification) and
                analyzing the details of the product at hand.</p>

                    <h5>FAMILIARIZATION</h5>
                    <p>My team familiarized ourselves with the interface of the Uber application and found it to be
                      seamless, intuitive, and legible, leading us to believe that Uber values the usability,
                      simplicity,
                      and convenience of its application by hiding the inner-workings of the service. Uber does allow
                      users
                      to opt-in or -out of their data collection services and links to their full privacy policy online,
                      but
                      this affordance doesn’t allow transparency with how Uber uses the data collected from its users
                      (for
                      example, <a

                    <p>How does Uber get away with collecting tons of data without worrying its users? In order to
                      answer
                      this, my team used defamiliarization to examine the navigational cues that lead Uber’s users
                      throughout the application. With the primary purpose of Uber being to request a ride, this
                      one-track
                      mindset is evident via the design of the landing screen, not allowing its users to strongly
                      consider
                      the data collection settings or their location privacies. The simplicity and intuitive nature of
                      Uber’s design enables its users to forgo the constant location surveillance and data collection
                      happening under the hood of the application.</p>

                defined five of the following design values needed for ethical surveillance. These values respond to
                Uber’s concern with efficiency and usability, and also align with user values in data collection and
                location surveillance. We used these values to drive our design decisions.

                      can
                      lead drivers to take their riders through more obscure neighborhoods to get to their destinations.
                      The
                      proposed redesign would allow riders to preview all the possible routes and select one before

                      allow riders to rate their drop-off and pick-up locations after the ride, improving Uber’s
                      algorithm

                      vehicles, and more drivers have been installing camera devices to protect themselves from false
                      claims.
                      Riders are often unaware of this, so in order to inform riders of the possibility of being
                      recorded
                      during a particular ride, we proposed having a opt-in or -out dialog in the rider’s application
                      before
                      each ride with a camera device. This would also require drivers to register their devices with the

                    <p>Stephanie just completed a work trip to Chicago. She is at Reagan National airport and it is
                      after
                      midnight. Stephanie needs to get home quickly to her apartment in downtown Washington, DC. The bus
                      and
                      metro have closed for the night, and the line for taxis seems to be taking at least 20 minutes.
                      The
                      fastest and cheapest option would be to call an Uber carpool to get home. Stephanie hesitates to
                      call
                      an
                      UberPool. The last time she took an UberPool, she was dropped off in an unsafe part of her
                      neighborhood.
                      Stephanie does not want this to happen again, especially because it is so late at night.
                    </p>

                      to film passengers. This concerns Stephanie—who has video footage of her? How many drivers are
                      conducting video surveillance on their riders?
                    </p>

                surveillance, I believe that having agency over how our personal data is collected leads us to feel more
                empowered by corporations that leverage big data without our active knowledge. Also, given our short
                timeline for the project, we didn’t fully flesh out the tradeoffs for the design propositions; after
                presenting our project to our class, my team and I recognized the biases that riders could potentially
                contribute to through the proposed rating system or route selection designs. Digging further into these
                concepts would help us combat any forms of bias that we may be contributing to in our design.
                Overall, this practice of critically thinking about existing pervasive technologies and the surveillance
                that accompanies them opened my eyes to examine other mindless interactions I have with technologies,
                growing my interest in research and analysis as a designer.
