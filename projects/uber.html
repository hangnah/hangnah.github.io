                    <h4>As an analysis of ethical surveillance in my human-computer interaction class, my team of three
                        other UCLA graduate students researched the ethics of data collection and design values of
                        ridesharing applications, specifically in Uber. We applied concepts of personas, infrastructural
                        inversion, and values in design to complete our analysis, and proposed three design solutions
                        that reflected our findings.</h4>

                    <h4>How might we make location surveillance more ethical?</h4>
                    <p>In many major cities, ridesharing applications are convenient and offer affordances that other
                        transportation services cannot offer. In order to do so, however, these ridesharing applications
                        keep records of user location data and traffic patterns to streamline their services –
                        <strong>performing heavy location surveillance that individuals may not be aware of.</strong>
                        With this issue of ethical surveillance in ridesharing applications in mind, my team used
                        personas, crafted situations, and conducted infrastructural inversion* to uncover our design
                        values that would help us analyze Uber’s design decisions and come to our own design decisions
                        to address the issue of ethical surveillance.</p>
                    <p><small>* <strong>Infrastructural inversion</strong> is a phrase coined by Star and Bowker in
                            their book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sorting-things-out"
                                target="_blank"><em>Sorting Things Out.</em></a> The process of infrastructural
                            inversion involves diving into the infrastructure and analyzing the details of the product
                            at hand.</small></p>

                    <h4>Analyzing Uber’s interface revealed several design values that may have driven their decisions
                        to hide their heavy location surveillance.
                    </h4>

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Familiarization</h5>
                    <p>My team familiarized ourselves with Uber’s mobile application interface and found it to
                        be
                        seamless, intuitive, and legible, leading us to believe that Uber champions the
                        <strong>usability, simplicity, and convenience</strong> of its application to hide their
                        location surveillance. Although Uber does allow users to opt-in or -out of their data
                        collection
                        services and provides links to their full privacy policies online, this affordance
                        doesn’t
                        provide transparency with how Uber uses the data collected from its users (for example,
                        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/how-uber-uses-its-data-bank.asp"
                            target="_blank">Uber selling data to generate revenue with partners</a>).</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Defamiliarization</h5>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How does Uber get away with collecting tons of data without worrying its
                            users?</strong>
                        In order to answer this, my team used defamiliarization to examine the navigational cues
                        that
                        lead Uber’s users throughout the application. Given Uber’s primary goal of requesting a
                        ride,
                        the design of the application seamlessly leads users through the ride-requesting process
                        from
                        the application’s first launch to the final push notification from a driver. This flow,
                        however,
                        discourages users from strongly considering their data collection settings, subsequently
                        contributing to their indifference of their location privacies. The simplicity of Uber’s
                        design
                        enables its users to forgo the constant location surveillance and data collection
                        happening
                        under the hood of the application.

                    <p>In order to explore this issue further, my team developed a persona to reflect an individual who
                        is <strong>cognizant of Uber’s location tracking services but unaware of how Uber uses this
                            data,</strong> making her uneasy with using Uber as a ride service. </p>

                        (2015), we defined five design values that contribute to ethical location
                        surveillance. These values align with Uber’s values of efficiency and usability, and also
                        respond to user concerns with data collection and location surveillance. These values were used
                        to drive our design decisions.

                                    completing a ride (Uber Nav, Waze, Google Maps). Each application has its own
                                    algorithm for calculating the fastest route for travel, which can guide drivers

                                    the safety of riders. This proposed design would allow riders to rate their drop-off

                                <p>Uber drivers have a right to record their rides using dashboard cameras both in and
                                    outside of their vehicles, and more drivers have been installing camera devices to
                                    protect themselves from false claims. Riders are often unaware of this, so in order
                                    to inform riders of the possibility of being recorded during their rides, we
                                    proposed having a opt-in or -out dialog in the rider’s application before each ride
                                    that has a camera device. A visible button toggle on the landing page would also
                                    remind riders of this privacy option. This would require drivers to register their
                                    camera devices with the Uber application.</p>

                                <p>Stephanie just completed a work trip to Chicago. She is at Reagan National airport
                                    and it
                                    is after midnight. Stephanie needs to get home quickly to her apartment in downtown
                                    Washington, DC. The bus and metro have closed for the night, and the line for taxis
                                    seems to be taking at least 20 minutes. The fastest and cheapest option would be to
                                    call
                                    an Uber carpool to get home. Stephanie hesitates to call an UberPool. The last time
                                    she
                                    took an UberPool, she was dropped off in an unsafe part of her neighborhood.
                                    Stephanie
                                    does not want this to happen again, especially because it is so late at night.</p>
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Stephanie can use the UberPool rating system to select her
                                    desired drop off spot, or use the route selection tool to choose a familiar route
                                    home.

                                    their cars in order to film passengers. This concerns Stephanie—who has video
                                    footage of her? How many drivers are conducting video surveillance on their riders?
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Stephanie can use the video privacy settings in her Uber
                                    application to pre-screen which drivers will have cameras installed in their cars.
                                    Additionally, she can quickly review her video privacy settings through the

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Reflection</h5>
                    <p>In all the design proposals my team came up with, <strong>the common value we upheld was agency –
                            being able to control what types of data that is collected and knowing how the data is being
                            used.</strong> Regarding ethical surveillance, I believe that having agency over how our
                        personal data is collected leads us to feel more empowered by corporations that leverage big
                        data without our active knowledge.</p>
                    <p>After a personal post-mortem reflection, I recognized flaws in our design solutions. Given the
                        short timeline that my team had for this project, we were unable to fully flesh out the
                        tradeoffs for our design propositions. One particular issue that should be addressed is the
                        negative bias that riders could potentially contribute to in certain neighborhoods by rating the
                        safety of routes or pick-up and drop-off locations. Spending more time digging into those
                        proposed solutions would help us uncover ways to combat potential negative biases.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I enjoyed this practice of critically examining pervasive technologies. Surveillance of
                        all forms is constant, and while it may provide convenience and contribute to better user
                        experiences, it is worth taking a step back to analyze the ethics of these technologies. This
                        project opened my eyes to consider other mindless interactions I have with technologies, growing
                        my interest in research and analysis as a designer.</p>
